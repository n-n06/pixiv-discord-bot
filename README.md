# A Discord bot to get illustrations from Pixiv

At this stage, I have only implemented a single function that gets a illustration by its ID on Pixiv. I tried to improve the way the embedded Pixiv illustrations are presented in Discord. The issue was that embedded pixiv illustrations would be cropped off to a horizontal image despite of the original orientation / aspect ration of the illustration.

### My next goal is to implement:
- Daily / Weekly rankings
- Tag search
- Optimize the code and split if up into modules
