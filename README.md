# pixivBot - Discord bot for pixiv

## Description
pixivBot is my personal project written in Python. :snake:
The main goal of this bot is to provide a fast way to view artworks :art: from pixiv.net using bot commands .
Later, I am planning to expand its functionality to fun stuff like playing music in VC :musical_note: :headphones: , managing mini-games :video_game:, etc.

## Usage
### Single illustrations
```
/illustration {illustration_id} [image size]
```

Sends the illustration's image :page_with_curl: with additional info like author's name, title of the artwork and corresponding tags.
